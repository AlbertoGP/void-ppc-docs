# How To Read The Documentation

This documentation does not intend to be a comprehensive resource on using
Void Linux, go read the official docs for that. The purpose of this is to
deal with matters specific to Void Linux on PowerPC, as well as organizational
matters and so on.

## Example Commands

Examples in this guide may have snippets of commands to be run in your shell.
When you see these, any line beginning with `$` is run as your normal user.
Lines beginning with `#` are run as `root`. After either of these lines, there
may be example output from the command.
