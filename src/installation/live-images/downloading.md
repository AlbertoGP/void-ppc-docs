# Downloading Images

All **live images** and **rootfs tarballs** are available at:

* [https://repo.voidlinux-ppc.org/live/current](https://repo.voidlinux-ppc.org/live/current)

There is a choice of a plain command line image and a graphical flavor with
the Xfce desktop environment. Other flavor images are currently not planned,
but you can install a desktop of your choice yourself.

It is recommended that you have enough RAM (at least 256 or 512MB) available
when using the graphical images.

## Verifying file integrity

The
[sha256sums.txt](https://repo.voidlinux-ppc.org/live/current/sha256sums.txt)
file contains the `SHA256` hashes to verify the integrity of the downloaded files.
