# Installation

As of 2019-03-30, there is no installation media provided, but it's possible to install the system manually without great difficulties.

`ppc64le` glibc is the best supported target right now and includes the majority of packages normally offered by Void. `ppc64le-musl` is catching up right now and should also provide a usable desktop system with several desktop environments. The big endian ports are installable but have much fewer packages built for now, same with the 32-bit ports. All targets are known to boot on their supported hardware.

## Preparation

You will need the following:

1. A USB stick of any Linux distribution for the target you want to install (64-bit little endian distro for 64-bit LE Void, 64-bit BE distro for 64-bit BE Void, for 32-bit you need any BE environment, either 64 or 32-bit)
2. A copy of the `xbps` package manager, available at https://void-power.octaforge.org/static/ - not needed when 1) is a Void image

Don't worry about the archives being marked `musl`, these work the same on `glibc` as well. The key point here is that the binaries are statically linked, so they will work on any distribution/environment regardless of the software packages you have. **You just need to get the right archive for the endianness you want.**

**It is advisable to get a modern distribution (for example, the latest version of Ubuntu or Fedora for little endian, and AdÃ©lie Linux for big endian as well as 32-bit) in order to not run into any issues with HTTPS certificates (all the links use Let's Encrypt).**

## Booting and setting up environment

Boot your Linux USB stick. If it does not come with `xbps`, fetch+extract the archive in a directory, like this:

```
$ # only for a 64-bit little endian system
$ wget https://void-power.octaforge.org/static/xbps-static-0.53_1.ppc64le-musl.tar.xz
$ # only for a 64-bit big endian system
$ wget https://void-power.octaforge.org/static/xbps-static-0.53_1.ppc64-musl.tar.xz
$ # only for a 32-bit system
$ wget https://void-power.octaforge.org/static/xbps-static-0.53_1.ppc-musl.tar.xz
$ mkdir sxbps && cd sxbps
$ tar xvf ../xbps-static*.tar.xz
```

You don't need most of the binaries, the one you are interested in is `xbps-install.static`, located in `usr/bin`.

**Also, everything mentioned in this guide should be run as root.**

### Setting up the target drive

#### OpenPOWER

On modern OpenPOWER hardware, such as Raptor Talos 2 or any IBM OpenPOWER system, you don't need to worry about much, as these systems use the Petitboot bootloader inside a Skiroot environment. You just need to select a target drive and create at least one partition on it. The way you do this depends on the distribution you currently have booted. As an example:

```
$ # our target drive is /dev/sda, we will use fdisk, which is commonly present
$ # do not type any of the comments in here (# foo) into the command line
$ fdisk /dev/sda # this brings up a prompt of a sort
> g # create a GUID partition table (GPT)
> n # create a single partition, confirm the pre-filled values to use entire disk
> w # write changes and quit
$ mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda1 # create an ext4 filesystem on the target drive
```

Now we have a target filesystem at `/dev/sda1`. Mount it:

```
$ mkdir -p /media/rootfs
$ mount /dev/sda1 /media/rootfs
```

And that's it.

#### PowerPC Macs

This is for NewWorld Macs only (all iMac, all iBook, Power Mac G3 Blue and White, Bronze keyboard PowerBook G3 and everything with G4/G5). OldWorld Macs don't support `GRUB` or `yaboot` and require special setup that will not be covered here.

PowerPC Mac systems use OpenFirmware. You will need to create an Apple Partition Map on the drive, in this kind of layout, when using the `GRUB2` bootloader: 

| Device    | Type                | Name      | Size | System             |
|-----------|---------------------|-----------|------|--------------------|
| /dev/sda1 | Apple_partition_map | Apple     | -    | Partition map      |
| /dev/sda2 | Apple_Bootstrap     | bootstrap | ~10M | NewWorld bootblock |
| /dev/sda3 | Apple_UNIX_SVR2     | rootfs    | any  | Linux native       |
| /dev/sda4 | Apple_UNIX_SVR2     | swap      | any  | Linux swap         |

You also have a choice of using the `yaboot` bootloader, which wants a smaller bootstrap partition around ~`800k`. `GRUB2` is more powerful, however. For instructions on how to use `yaboot`, you will need to look it up elsewhere.

You will need `mac-fdisk` installed to partition the drive. Void Live images supply that by default, in other distributions you can install it from their repositories.

First partition is also the partition table. Swap is optional. You can use `pmac-fdisk` (if not present, it can also be called `mac-fdisk`) to create the partition layout for `GRUB2`:

```
$ pmac-fdisk /dev/sda
> i                                  # partition table
> C 2p 10M bootstrap Apple_Bootstrap # bootstrap partition
> c 3p 120G rootfs                   # rootfs partition
> c 4p 4p swap                       # swap partition
> w                                  # write, confirm
> q                                  # quit
```

To explain what's going on here: The Apple Partition Map is also a partition in itself. The `i` command will create it and it will be `/dev/sda1`. Then we need to create the bootstrap partition. For `yaboot`, which only needs a specific `800k` sized partition, there is already a command called `b` but we need a bigger partition. Therefore, we'll be using the full `C` command which takes partition start as the first argument, size as the second, name as the third and type as the fourth argument. You can specify `<number>p` for either the start or the size; when we say `2p` for the start, it refers to the free space partition, i.e. the bootstrap partition will begin where the free space partition begins.

For rootfs, we need the `Apple_UNIX_SVR2` partition type, so the more compact `c` command can be used (or you can use `C` and supply the fourth argument). You can specify `3p` as length if you don't want swap and want to fill the rest of the disk. You can use the `p` command anytime to show the current layout.

Proceed to format the root filesystem partition with the filesystem of your choice:

```
$ mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda3
```

With the filesystem ready, mount the rootfs:

```
$ mkdir -p /media/rootfs
$ mount /dev/sda3 /media/rootfs
```

And that's it. We'll take care of formatting and setting up the bootstrap partition from within the installed system later.

#### SLOF (non-Mac OpenFirmware)

Non-Mac OpenFirmware is different. You will need a `PReP` partition and a root partition at least. You should just use the GPT partition table.

```
$ # our target drive is /dev/sda, we will use fdisk, which is commonly present
$ # do not type any of the comments in here (# foo) into the command line
$ fdisk /dev/sda # this brings up a prompt of a sort
> g # create a GUID partition table (GPT)
> n # create a partition for PReP boot, primary, ~10M
> t # change partition type to PowerPC PReP boot
> n # create a second partition and fill the rest of the disk
> w # write changes and quit
$ mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda2 # create an ext4 filesystem on the target drive
```

When using the `t` command to change the partition type, `PowerPC PReP boot` should be `7`. However, it could be different on older versions, so list them if unsure; `fdisk` will tell you what type it's changing to.

Now we have a target filesystem at `/dev/sda2`. Mount it:

```
$ mkdir -p /media/rootfs
$ mount /dev/sda2 /media/rootfs
```

And that's it.

## Installing initial system

Let's assume we have a target rootfs partition mounted at `/media/rootfs`, as set up in the section above. Change your current directory to the `usr/bin` location where you extracted the static `xbps` archive, so that `xbps-install.static` is present in the current directory.

Then proceed to install a minimal system. Again, anything `# foo` is a comment.

```
$ export XBPS_ARCH=ppc64le # ppc64 for big endian, append -musl for musl
$ # install base-voidstrap, a minimal base system package for container environments
$ # -R == repository URL, -r == target directory, -S == sync
$ # add /be to URL for big endian, and /musl for musl (/be/musl for BE musl)
$ # use just xbps-install if host distro comes with xbps
$ ./xbps-install.static -R https://repo.void-ppc64.octaforge.org/current -r /media/rootfs -S base-voidstrap
```

This will get a minimal system installed. We're not installing a full system yet, as we're not sure about the outside environment's software selection. The smaller the system is, the less likely it is to result in a failure.

Now we will need to set up the target so that we can chroot into it.

```
$ cp /etc/resolv.conf /media/rootfs/etc # for network access
$ cp /etc/hosts /media/rootfs/etc       # for network access
$ mount --bind /dev /media/rootfs/dev
$ mount --bind /proc /media/rootfs/proc
$ mount --bind /sys /media/rootfs/sys
```

If the `dev`, `proc` and `sys` directories do not exist in the target for some reason, create them. This is a sign of a failed configuration step, if the output of `xbps-install` doesn't show any errors, you should probably be fine.

Now is time to switch to the target system and install the rest of it.

```
$ chroot /media/rootfs
```

If the configuration failed for whatever reason, reconfigure the installed packages. You can most likely do this anyway, it will not do any harm, but it should not be necessary if the initial system installation did not fail.

```
$ xbps-reconfigure -f base-files # will populate the rootfs with necessary dirs if not done already
$ xbps-reconfigure -f -a         # reconfigure all packages
```

## Configuring the system

We can proceed to install everything else.

```
$ update-ca-certificates   # just in case, make sure the certs are all up to date
$ xbps-install -S          # fetch package database from repository
$ xbps-install base-system # this is a full base package with a kernel etc.
```

At the point of writing this, the default kernel is 4.19. Our kernels are generic, i.e. for 64-bit big endian systems they're built for POWER4 and newer. They are known for panic on modern POWER8 and newer hardware; this seems to have gotten fixed with kernel 5.0. Therefore, if you are installing a big endian system, you will need to install a 5.0 or newer kernel (or recompile the 4.19 kernel for POWER8 and newer CPUs). On little endian, there is no problem and you don't have to do anything (they are compiled for POWER8 by default).

```
$ xbps-install linux5.0
```

For glibc targets, it is necessary to enable a locale. The list is in `/etc/default/libc-locales`. You then need to reconfigure the appropriate package. For example:

```
$ sed -i 's/#en_US.UTF-8/en_US.UTF-8/' /etc/default/libc-locales
$ xbps-reconfigure -f glibc-locales
$ echo 'LANG=en_US.UTF-8' > /etc/locale.conf
```

You also need to set a timezone and a hostname.

```
$ echo 'TIMEZONE="Europe/Prague"' >> /etc/rc.conf
$ echo foo > /etc/hostname
```

You need to set the root password, otherwise you will not be able to log in in the target system.

```
$ passwd root
```

Finally, enable some services by default.

```
$ ln -s /etc/sv/dhcpcd /etc/runit/runsvdir/default/
$ ln -s /etc/sv/sshd /etc/runit/runsvdir/default/
```

You need `dhcpcd` for internet access (it's set up for DHCP out of box, can be configured for static IP) and `sshd` is optional. You can pre-enable any other services in `/etc/sv` the same way.

## Bootloader setup

### OpenPOWER

As OpenPOWER systems use Petitboot, which is embedded in the firmware, there is very little you have to do. Only a few things:

```
$ xbps-install grub-utils  # to generate a grub.cfg
$ mkdir -p /boot/grub
```

We only install the utils, as we'll be using those to generate a `GRUB` configuration file, which Petitboot can read and parse. Edit `/etc/default/grub` to update your kernel commandline. It is also a good idea to add the following line:

```
GRUB_DISABLE_OS_PROBER=true
```

This drastically reduces the time needed to generate the configuration file, and `os-prober` is kinda useless on Petitboot anyway as it scans every storage medium separately.

You might also want to tweak `GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT` (clearing all contents works, but results in a verbose output). If you are on an OpenPOWER system and plan to have your default console go to a dedicated GPU instead of the onboard ASpeed VGA, add `modprobe.blacklist=ast` to it, but this is dependent on the particular hardware you are using and not specific to Void.

Finally, generate the configuration file

```
$ update-grub
```

#### PowerPC Macs

We will need to install the OpenFirmware bootloader:

```
$ xbps-install grub-utils grub-powerpc-ieee1275
```

Also utilities to deal with HFS:

```
$ xbps-install hfsutils hfsprogs
```

Then create a mountpoint for the bootstrap partition, format it and mount it:

```
$ mkdir -p /media/bootstrap
$ dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sda2 bs=512
$ hformat -l bootstrap /dev/sda2
$ mount -t hfs /dev/sda2 /media/bootstrap
```

And proceed to install the bootloader, then unmount the bootstrap partition:

```
$ grub-install --macppc-directory=/media/bootstrap /dev/sda # specifying the device is optional
$ umount /media/bootstrap
$ rmdir /media/bootstrap
```

Unfortunately, that's not all you need to do. You still need to bless the directory with the bootloader and set up the file type for the boot script:


```
$ hmount /dev/sda2
$ hattrib -t tbxi -c UNIX :System:Library:CoreServices:BootX
$ hattrib -b :System:Library:CoreServices
$ humount
```

Finally, generate the configuration file:

```
$ update-grub
```

Now your installed system should be bootable without any further intervention. If graphical `GRUB` for some reason fails to start (happens in QEMU), you will need to modify `/etc/default/grub` (you can use the live media and `chroot` into the system again) and uncomment the following line:

```
GRUB_TERMINAL_OUTPUT=console
```

and then run `update-grub` again. You can also add `GRUB_DISABLE_OS_PROBER=true` to prevent `update-grub` from scanning other drives, which speeds it up considerably. Again, you can also tweak `GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT`, clear to empty for most verbose output.

#### Other OpenFirmware

We will need to install the OpenFirmware bootloader:

```
$ xbps-install grub-utils grub-powerpc-ieee1275
```

Then we will need to install the bootloader into the `PowerPC PReP boot` partition, with some files going to `/boot/grub`. That's easy:

```
$ grub-install --boot-directory=/boot /dev/sda1 # must point it to the PReP partition
$ update-grub
```

Before doing `update-grub`, maybe tweak your `/etc/default/grub`, see the OpenPOWER section.

## Booting

A system set up like this should be bootable. For usage, follow the Void Linux handbook: https://docs.voidlinux.org/
